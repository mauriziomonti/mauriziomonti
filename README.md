***School Of Code journal***

1) Day 1 <br>
The day started on a light note, intro into what the bootcamp is and how we'll be trained and coached.

2) Day 2


3) Day 3


4) Day 4  <br>
The day started well, feeling confident with yesterday's JavaScript. <br>
Had a mindset session with Joseph Trodden, eye opening as it describes exactly the journey, clarifying and outlining the steps ahead. <br>
JavaScript is still my nemesis!

5) Day 5 <br>
Hackathon day!
We created the Rock-Scissors-Paper game. I can see the sintax is getting better and planning abilities too, at least I don't try and jump into coding wihout a plan anymore :).

6) Day 6 <br>
Learning to manipulate and interact webpages is great. Now I know how to do pranks too! <br>
Also, met my mentor today, chilled guy with lots of experience. It was an initial meeting to introduce ourselves and discussed platforms, technologies and possible job roles.
