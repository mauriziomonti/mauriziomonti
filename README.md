***School Of Code journal***

1) Day 1

The day started on a light note, intro into what the bootcamp is and how we'll be trained and coached.

2) Day 2


3) Day 3


4) Day 4
The day started well, feeling confident with yesterday's JavaScript.
Had a mindset session. Eye opening as it describes exactly the journey, clarifying and outlining the steps ahead.
JavaScript is still my nemesis!
